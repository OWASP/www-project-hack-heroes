### Preamble

```
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for it if you wish) without having to pay royalties to previous authors.

For example, if you buy a book, you have the right to read it, to give it away to others, and to teach others to read it. You should also be able to modify it, for example by taking notes in the margins or by translating it into another language. Software should be so free.

The GNU Affero General Public License applies to software that is designed to be run over a network. If you develop such software, you should make sure that users who interact with it over the network have the same freedoms that they would have if they used the software directly on their own computers.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For example, the source code for a program is the set of instructions written in a programming language that specifies the actions to be performed by the computer when the program is run.

The GNU Affero General Public License requires that modified versions of the program be marked in a way that clearly distinguishes them from the original version. For example, if you modify a program, you should change its name or version number, or both.

The GNU Affero General Public License also requires that when you distribute copies of the program, whether modified or unmodified, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. That means you must distribute the source code, and you must keep intact all notices that refer to the GNU Affero General Public License and to the absence of any warranty.

There are some things that you must not do. You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights of the recipients of the program. You may not use the program to restrict others from having the same freedoms that you received. For example, you may not use the program to build a proprietary software service that denies users the freedom to share and change the software they use.

There are also some things that you should do. You should make sure that users who interact with your software over a network have the same freedoms that they would have if they used the software directly on their own computers. You should also make sure that the source code for your software is available to users who interact with it over the network.

The GNU Affero General Public License is intended to ensure that everyone has the freedom to use, modify, and distribute software, and to ensure that modified versions of the software are also free. It is an important part of the free software movement, and it is essential for the protection of your freedoms as a user and developer of software.

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

```
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along with this program. If not, see [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
