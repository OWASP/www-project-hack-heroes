### Road Map
Currently there are 6 challenges, 5 'gadgets' for solving challenges, and a simple presentation layer. Future plans include:

* Authoring more challenges aligned with early computer science learning objectives.
* Piloting in schools and gathering feedback.
* Creating a knowledgebase for deeper learning.
* Considering server-based support for leaderboards and progress saving.
* Expanding challenge sets for different ages and difficulty levels.

### Data & Privacy
Hack Heroes stores anonymous challenge status data in your browser. No personal information is required or stored on servers.
