Hack Heroes is an open-source project designed to teach young learners about cybersecurity and web security in a fun, interactive, and educational way. The ultimate aim is to inspire young people to consider cybersecurity and technology careers. There is currently a significant gap in the industry when it comes to resources for young people. The project offers simple in-browser application security challenges aimed at kids aged 8-14, but the engaging nature of the tasks makes it enjoyable for users of all ages.

### Road Map
Currently there are 6 challenges, 5 'gadgets' which users can use to solve challenges, and a simple overall presentation layer. This has been tested with a small sample of young people so far. Going forward:

* Author a further 6 challenges (aligned with early computer science learning objectives) to create an initial core storyline that can be used in schools.
* Work with UK STEM ambassadors ([https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors|https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors]) to pilot in schools and gather feedback from participants.
* Create a knowledgebase element to the software so that young people can dive deeper on the topics behind the challenges and learn about about the underlying principles.
* Consider developing server-based support for leaderboards and/or the ability to save/restore progress in a different browser.
* Create further sets of challenges for different ages and levels of difficulty, ideally tying in more explicitly with cybersecurity careers and careers resources.
